## Website Project 2019

## Welcome

Hey there, we are glad you are interested in making yet another impact with **NaijaHacks**, we are optimistic on what you would help the community achieve.

## Understanding the codebase

This project has a simple setup, we have intended to use vanilla `Javascript`, `HTML`, and `css/scss`.

To make the development experience smoother, this project uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle assests. You may wish to go through their documentations [here](https://webpack.js.org/concepts).
